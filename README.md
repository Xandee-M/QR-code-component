## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I just wanted to share with you all about the frontend coding challenge I completed. This incredible challenge is part of Frontend Mentor, a platform that helps improve our coding skills through the construction of realistic projects.

To complete this challenge, a basic understanding of HTML and CSS was necessary. Fortunately, I was already somewhat familiar with these technologies, which made the process smoother.

The challenge's objective was to build a QR code component and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible. It was a fantastic opportunity to apply my knowledge of style, layout, and responsiveness. I had the freedom to choose the tools that best suited my workflow, which was really cool.

Building this project was both a fun and educational experience. I gained more confidence in my coding skills and learned some useful tips along the way. ðŸš€
